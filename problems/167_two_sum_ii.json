  "title": "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "description": "Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\n\nReturn the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.\n\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n\nYour solution must use only constant extra space.\n\nConstraints:\n- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4\n- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000\n- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order\n- -1000 <= target <= 1000\n- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.",
  "examples": [
    "Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].",
    "Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].",
    "Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]."
