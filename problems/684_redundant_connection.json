  "description": "In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.\n\nYou are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.\n\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.\n\nConstraints:\n- n == edges.length\n- 3 <= n <= 1000\n- edges[i].length == 2\n- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length\n- ai != bi\n- There are no repeated edges.\n- The given graph is connected.",
