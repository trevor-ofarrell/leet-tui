  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "description": "There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.\n\nYou are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= n <= 100\n- 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)\n- flights[i].length == 3\n- 0 <= fromi, toi < n\n- fromi != toi\n- 1 <= pricei <= 10^4\n- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.\n- 0 <= src, dst, k < n\n- src != dst",
