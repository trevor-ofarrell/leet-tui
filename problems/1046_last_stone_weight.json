  "description": "You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.\n\nWe are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:\n- If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and\n- If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.\n\nAt the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.\n\nReturn the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= stones.length <= 30\n- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000",
