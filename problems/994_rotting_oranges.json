  "description": "You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:\n\n- 0 representing an empty cell,\n- 1 representing a fresh orange, or\n- 2 representing a rotten orange.\n\nEvery minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\n\nReturn the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.\n\nConstraints:\n- m == grid.length\n- n == grid[i].length\n- 1 <= m, n <= 10\n- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.",
  "examples": [
    "Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]\nOutput: 4",
    "Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten.",
    "Input: grid = [[0,2]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since there are no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is 0."
