  "description": "Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\n\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \"The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\"",
  "examples": [
    "Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8\nOutput: 6",
