  "description": "A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:\n\n- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.\n- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.\n- sk == endWord\n\nGiven two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10\n- endWord.length == beginWord.length\n- 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000\n- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length\n- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.\n- beginWord != endWord\n- All the words in wordList are unique.",
  "examples": [
    "Input: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: One shortest transformation sequence is \"hit\" -> \"hot\" -> \"dot\" -> \"dog\" -> \"cog\", which is 5 words long.",
    "Input: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The endWord \"cog\" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence."
