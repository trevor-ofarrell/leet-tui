  "description": "You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].\n\nThe cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.\n\nReturn the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= points.length <= 1000\n- -10^6 <= xi, yi <= 10^6\n- All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.",
