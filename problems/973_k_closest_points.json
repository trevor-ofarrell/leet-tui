  "description": "Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n\nThe distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²).\n\nYou may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4\n- -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4",
  "examples": [
    "Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1\nOutput: [[-2,2]]\nExplanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.",
    "Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2\nOutput: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\nExplanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted."
