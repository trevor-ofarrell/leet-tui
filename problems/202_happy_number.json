  "description": "Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.\n\nA happy number is a number defined by the following process:\n\n- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.\n- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.\n- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.\n\nReturn true if n is a happy number, and false if not.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1",
