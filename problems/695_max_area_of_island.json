  "description": "You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n\nThe area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n\nReturn the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n\nConstraints:\n- m == grid.length\n- n == grid[i].length\n- 1 <= m, n <= 50\n- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.",
