  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\n\nA valid BST is defined as follows:\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\n- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.",
  "examples": [
    "Input: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: true",
    "Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4."
