  "description": "You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.\n\nWe will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= k <= n <= 100\n- 1 <= times.length <= 6000\n- times[i].length == 3\n- 1 <= ui, vi <= n\n- ui != vi\n- 0 <= wi <= 100\n- All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique.",
