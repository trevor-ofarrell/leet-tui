  "description": "Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:\n[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.",
  "examples": [
    "Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 1",
    "Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\nOutput: 0"
