  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.\n\nYou are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.\n\nReturn an array containing the answers to the queries.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5\n- 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5\n- intervals[i].length == 2\n- 1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^7\n- 1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7",
