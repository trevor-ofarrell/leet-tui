  "description": "Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].\n\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.\n\nConstraints:\n- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30\n- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\nFollow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)",
